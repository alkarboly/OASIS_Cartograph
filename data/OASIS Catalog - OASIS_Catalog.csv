Shortly after establishing their initial base of operations, the rat's worked feverishly to get their Ratchat Comms and Dispatch Board Relay stations up and running, performing their first rescues not long after.

Focus then shifted to building out a full service Coriolis Starport, Racso's Rescue, where you'll find a well stocked shipyard and outfitter (with a full range of fuel scoops), as well as repair, refuel, and rearm services. These services are backed by a strong industrial economy, supplying all the materials and machinery you need for your own colonization efforts. 

As for future plans, the Fuel Rats will continue to build out the infrastructure needed to support this growing colony. (Rumor has it, the famed research arm of the NIMH may establish a new base of operations in the system)

As the first extraction and industrial system developed by the EBTC (East Bubble Trading Company) outside of core space, DM99 54.1 marks the beginning of a new era of off-Bubble expansion and resource exploitation.

The system is rich in unrefined materials, gas reservoirs, and asteroid mining sites, all of which are resources that promised substantial wealth during initial surveys. True to projections, these assets have become the backbone of EBTC’s early off-Bubble portfolio. Although infrastructure growth remains undeveloped, EBTC’s presence is steadily transforming DM99 54.1 into a strategic industrial foothold within the Orion Nebula and its sectors, planned to be constructed with mining sites, orbital refineries, and fairly compensated living conditions.

Despite its remote location and logistical challenges, DM99 54.1 represents a growing symbol of EBTC’s ambition, and a critical testing ground for long-term industrial operations in deep space. The system is currently classified as “development tier 2” with expansion expected to accelerate as supply lines stabilize and output volumes increase.

In time, DM99 54.1 may evolve from a bold gamble into one of the EBTC’s most valuable off-Bubble assets.",

Located just next to the trade lanes threading through the 2nd Orion Star Clusters, this system serves as a secondary extraction and industrial hub, mirroring its predecessor in both design and ambition.

Like DM99 54.1, 2MASS J05362504+1001544 boasts rich resource deposits, notably void opals, low temp diamonds, and tritium. Initial operations have confirmed the system's potential as a reliable supplier of mid-tier industrial materials. EBTC has established an orbital outpost, all running on a slow but consistent ramp-up model.

Though still in its early development phase, the system is already showing signs of becoming a stable support node for EBTC’s growing presence in the Orion periphery. Its proximity to DM99 54.1 allows for shared supply routes and mutual logistical reinforcement, enabling both systems to evolve in tandem.

2MASS J05362504+1001544 represents the next step in EBTC’s long-term strategy, an expansion across resource-rich, low-conflict zones beyond the Bubble. If current growth trends hold, the system is expected to reach development tier 2 status within the next few months, solidifying its role in EBTC’s rising industrial ventures.",
